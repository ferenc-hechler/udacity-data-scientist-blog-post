       "[\"Unfortunately my experience with the Belltown apartment in Seattle is very very disappointing :(  I hate to complain or write negative reviews, however I have to do it.\\r\\nThe first, this apartment we booked for 3 guests. There is a king size bed for 2 people and for a third person  a very small, tiny and narrow sofa, that is good enough to have a short nap!!!!  When I called to a property management and told that... The answer was : we can deliver a air bed for 50$ delivery fee ?!?!? Why ?!? We paid for a night 319$ US. \\r\\nThe second one, there is NO internet ! We again, called to the property managemnet and asked if there is a wireless or wired Internet ! The man on the phone said,he would call to the owner and asked for a WIFI password and log in. Never called  us back :( \\r\\nThe third, it was very cold in the appartment ! There is no an instruction or a guest info book or so... \\r\\nWe at our own risk, opened the hitter's vents and eventually it was little bit warmer! \\r\\nOne more thing... The building is very old so it is very smelly :( .. \\r\\nThe next one, we also paid a cleaning fee 84$. But all hitters are dusty.\\r\\nThe last,  but also very stressful... The address of the building  is 304 Bell street , and there should be a lock with an apartment's key, but the lock was attached to the 308 Bell street building's door :( who knew it ?!? :( \\r\\nto figure out all these issues I had to call to the property management several times by using my cell with roaming rate and now I can imagine my Fido bill !   stay away from this place ! I am  a Airbnb member since 2011, I am not picky at all,  but this time it was to much :( \",\n",
       " \"Tim was very responsive and clear in his instructions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment has a great location and in a really nice area with lotsa food and supermarkets nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery comfortable apartment for 2. Large-screen TV with many channels available. Wifi was not made available tho.\\r\\n\\r\\nApartment was set-up like a bachelor's apartment, rather than a place expecting guests. So it's kinda messy & the smells of men's cologne & old sheets remain. Bathroom and Carpet need some cleaning too.\",\n",
       " 'Tim was a good host and was very responsive to our needs.  His apartment is very new and in a cool part of Seattle surrounded by lots of trendy bars and restaurants.  One of the best oyster bars in the city is on the ground floor of his building! ',\n",
       " \"I stayed at Vivian's place since it was located in SLU, the area where I had to work for a few days. The place was clean, located in a very nice neighborhood. I didn't get the chance to meet Vivian personally, but her boyfriend and their friend welcomed me. The room was very clean and the place has a full kitchen that you could use. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, I was disappointed that this place doesn't have a private bathroom which was different from the listing description. I knew this after I requested to book. One night, at around midnight, it was extremely loud that I couldn't sleep since Oscar and his friend were playing xbox until like 1am with a loud shouting. I felt like I am staying at college dorm :-(  Since I had to work, I wished it was more quiet at night and they were more considerate to guests. Another thing was that I had to call someone (their friend) to enter the house each time. Hope these are things that future guests might want to know before booking, and I hope Vivian and her friends who stay there can improve!  \",\n",
       " \"TL;DR - This place has a ton of potential, but I can't recommend it due to the complete lack of responsiveness of the host (never once responded to any of our concerns in the 4 nights we stayed), the lack of WiFi when it was promised, the bath tub drain was clogged, and the total lack of basic essentials like toilet paper and hand soap.       \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPROS: \\r\\nThe location was great and the apartment was nice.       \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONS:\\r\\nHowever, after dropping the keys, the host mentioned she didn't have the wifi password on her, and that she'd run to the office and message me later. She then left to let us settle in. We first noticed there was no hand soap or toilet paper in the bathroom. So I messaged her, and got no response. I messaged her later about the WiFi, which looked like the modem wasn't connected to the Comcast backbone, and never got a response. We ended up going to Target to stock up on TP and soap.       \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, when we used the shower, the bath tub drain was almost completely clogged, and there was a residue on the bath tub floor. I texted the host again, and got no response. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",

Which is unfortunate. \\r\\n\\r\\nHere's a list of issues:\\r\\n1. I never spoke with the owners. The house is run by Pillow, a management co. This is a critical part of the AirBnB experience to me -- knowing who you're dealing with and getting their perspective on the community. Also, only the owners know how the house is set up. \\r\\n2. The management company, Pillow, is pretty incompetent. I had problems getting my key (the instructions were vague). I called them twice, waiting 15 rings (!) before someone picked up. That person then just repeated the same vague instructions. Unhelpful. \\r\\n3. THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME $25 FOR AN EXTRA PILLOW. And wouldn't give extra blankets. The house is *huge*. Surely there's an extra pillow somewhere? But all the cabinets were locked.  Because of bad pillows, I spent most of Sunday with pretty nasty neck pain. \\r\\n4. Never in my entire AirBnB history can I remember someone refusing to let us check out after 11am. \\r\\n5. Uncomfortable, cheap linens, thin pillows, and comforters that obviously came from the management co.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI bet the owners are kind people, and the house *is* beautiful.
